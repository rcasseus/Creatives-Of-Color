# Creatives-Of-Color
This project is to help promote people of color in our creative industry.
I made this with the hope of show new and current creatives that there are other people like you in this field.

This runs off a google sheets file. Coded with javascript and some jquery. 
All props to stackoverflow and Javascript and Jquery by Jon Duckett

Now go laugh at my code its ok. At least I made it work.
